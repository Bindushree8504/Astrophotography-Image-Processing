# Project Name

### Project Description:
#### Summary -
Astrophotography image processing enhances the quality of deep-sky images by refining their color, detail, and clarity. 
The workflow typically includes:
Preprocessing: Calibration using dark frames, flat frames, and bias frames to remove sensor noise and optical artifacts.
Alignment and Stacking: Combining multiple images to reduce noise and improve signal-to-noise ratio.
Postprocessing: Techniques like color balancing, noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and sharpening to highlight details like nebulae or galaxies.
Advanced Methods: Applying filters, wavelet transforms, and AI-based tools for finer detail extraction and noise suppression.
